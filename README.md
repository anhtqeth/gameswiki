# gameswiki
This is my repository for a web project. This will be used to store data of a certain games in a wiki like manner. Later, this project will be used as a baseline for multiple videogames

## Why?
I hosted a website named ethugamer.com in which I shared my guides on my PS4 games library. Most of these games contain RPG Element and certain universal aspect as Loots or Equipments stats and details.
 Monster Hunter World (MHW) or Nioh is two main feature games right now. 
In the long run, I want to create another site linked to the main site that supplement the information with details on items and some fancy build guidance. Things are uncertain yet.
